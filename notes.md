he padding of an object in Tailwind is the space that elements have inside. So if you add padding to an element, the elements within the elements get space. 

Margin is the space outside of elements. So while padding is inside (highlightet in red in the next screenshot) padding mt-8 is outside the element and simply moves it to the bottom.



Big Idea - The component in a bottom tab navigator can be a stack navigator and not just a screen. This way
You can combine BottomTab and Stack navigation

- react-native-svg provides SVG support to your React Native project on both Android and iOS platforms. 
  react-native-svg-transformer enables you to import local SVG files in your React Native project, 
  like how you would do in a Creact React App project on the web.
