# Contributing to XOneFi
Hi there! Thanks for taking your time to contribute!

We welcome everyone to contribute and we value each contribution, even the smallest ones! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Code of Conduct

Please be mindful to respect our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/xmeshlab/xonefi-android/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/xmeshlab/xonefi-android/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/xmeshlab/xonefi-android/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good and thorough bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
