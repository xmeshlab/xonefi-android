# Important Details Concerning Project Structure

The `tailwind.config.js` file houses paths that employ NativeWind for styling. When creating an additional directory containing files that use NativeWind for styling, ensure to append the new path in this file.

# Technologies

The XOneFi Android application is built utilizing React Native, Expo, NativeWind CSS, and React Navigation.

- NativeWind CSS - NativeWind, an implementation of Tailwind for React Native, provides the styling for this mobile application. Visit the [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) website for more information.

- React Navigation - React Navigation facilitates the mobile application's navigation. More about [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) can be found on their official website.

- The navigation strategy combines Stack and BottomTabNavigation. [BottomTabNavigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/) controls the Bottom Navigation Buttons. At the same time, the [Stack Navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/#api-definition) is employed when the application navigates from one screen to another, which is not one of the main home screens, upon pressing a button on a specific screen. Documentation on [how to use the two navigators in conjunction](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/) is available.
